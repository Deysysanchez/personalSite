Summer GWC
-This summer has been so much fun,I knew a bit of coding, because of my past experiences from being in a computer principal class. But coming but the past weeks attending this program Iâ€™ve gotten a better understanding of coding and I also have mande new friends from different cities that I would never have met. This has inspire me and build a great understanding on what Im going to be majoring in the future and that will be something within the STEM field.
I've learned to that although there isnt a lot of females in the STEM field; me joining the community can bring more inspirations to other girls that they can do it too.


Future goals:
I want to attend a 4 year college.
Double major in Computer Science and Cybersecurity.
